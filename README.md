### 👋 Hi, I’m Jagmohan Dixit (@Jaz108)

🚀 I'm a DevOps Engineer with 3+ years of hands-on experience building and automating scalable cloud infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Hetzner.

🔧 My toolbox includes Terraform, Kubernetes (CKA certified), Vault, Jenkins, Ansible, GitLab CI, and Python.
📦 Recent projects:
- Built multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters with Helm, Longhorn, and Prometheus monitoring
- Automated VM inventory, backup scripts, and CI/CD bootstrapping with Python & Ansible
- Migrated workloads from Docker Swarm to RKE2 clusters

🎯 I’m currently learning:  
- Advanced Kubernetes patterns (service meshes, GitOps)
- Scaling DevOps best practices for production workloads
- Fixing CI/CD issue across Jenkins and Github Actions.

💡 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source infra automation tools
- Monitoring & alerting integrations (Loki, Prometheus, Alertmanager)
- Cloud-native backup or secrets management systems
